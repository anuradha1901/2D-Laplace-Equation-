## WHAT
In this project I will find the numerical solution to the Partial Differential Equation using the Finite Difference Method (FDM). According to Wikipedia, in numerical analysis, finite - difference methods are a class of numerical techniques for solving differential equations by approximating derivatives with finite differences. Here the spatial domain and the time interval are broken down into a number of sections, which is also known as discretization, and the values at those points or coordinates is approximated by solving algebraic equations containing finite differences and values from the points around them. This system of linear equations is solved using the Conjugate Gradient method. According to Wikipedia, the conjugate gradient method is an algorithm for the numerical solution of particular system of linear equations. This is an iterative algorithm that can handle huge matrices. This method is often used when there are sparse matrices which we get to see a lot
in the solving of partial differential equations. The Finite Difference Method solves the equation using a grid. The solution is found for the domain grid points using the boundary grid points.
